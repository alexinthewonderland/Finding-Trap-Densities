# Finding-Trap-Densities
Hello! 

In this project contains the code made by me in the summer of my first year (2021) in university under [Professor Kam Sing Wong](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=8ql1t2EAAAAJ&hl=en). Its main function is to fit the Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) plot of a 2D Dion-Jacobson Perovskite Material in order to find the Trap Density of the sample in study. Here the 2D DJ perovskite material is one of the sample with a reported high stability. Hence, bringing to light its optical characteristics and charge recombination properties will aid the development for their usage in optoelectronics such as LEDs, solar cells, and laser diodes.

For very thorough detail about the project and results obtained, please do look at the [UROP1000 report](https://github.com/alexinthewonderland/Finding-Trap-Densities/blob/main/UROP1000%20Report.pdf) pdf file.

Enjoy your time here!
